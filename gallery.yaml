  Our project is a web scraper that gets data from Fox Sports and displays it
  to the user. The user can select a sport and a player, and the program will
  scrape the data from the web using Mechaml and display it to the user. The
  user can run the program through the command line or through a GUI.

  Several sports are supported, including baseball, basketball, and football.
